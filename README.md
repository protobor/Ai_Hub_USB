fe1.1s hub
==========

cloned from https://github.com/acrobotic/Ai_Hub_USB

Fork
----

 * completely redesigned
 * added support for gang power control (tested, ok)
 * will correctly switch between bus power and external power (self powered signal is inverted)

Issues
------

 * MOSFET footprint is fu...., so to assembly you'll need to bend legs and solder it upside down;
 * Something wrong with milling for usb micro b connector;
 * Bus powered and self powered signals inverted.
